This project is an arcade game, part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree in Udacity

## Installation
You just need a web browser to open the file **index.html**

## Usage
In this game you have a player that you can control with the arrow keys. The goal of the player is to reach the water while avoiding the enemies (bugs).

Every time the player reaches the water the score will increase one points. The player has also three lives and will loose a live if he collides with an enemy.

There will also randomly appear gems and hearts on the board. The gems will give you two points and the hearts one extra live.

The game will finish when you get seven points or you have no lives :(
